Iron from dust deposition (atmospheric input)

- Data source: ACCESS AM2 data on dust deposition for 2015-2019 (from Jakob Weis et al. 2024. One-third of Southern Ocean productivity is supported by dust deposition)

Methods:
1. Monthly data on dust deposition was averaged to get a single value per month. Variable of interest is dust_total_dep, which is the sum of all dust classes. Fluxes are in kg m-2 s-1; these should be converted to mg m-2 d-1 for clarity.
2. Assuming iron content in dust, I apply an estimated 3.5 wt.% of iron content in total dust (from Mahowald et al. 2005. Atmospheric global dust cycle and iron inputs to the ocean) and a fractional iron solubility of dust-derived iron of 5 to 15% (from Perron et al. 2020. Origin, transport and deposition of aerosol iron to Australian coastal waters). The latter estimate needs to be discussed with experts in East Antarctica (Sian?)
