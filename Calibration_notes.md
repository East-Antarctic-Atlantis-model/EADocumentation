# EAAM Calibration notes
The original model has been modified in several ways:
- a box has been added (box id: 22) in the southern Kerguelen plateau in recognition of circulation patterns intensifying in that area, affecting nurseries of fish groups.
- ACCESS-OM2 model now provides flow and variables for physical configuration of the model, rather than ROMS.
