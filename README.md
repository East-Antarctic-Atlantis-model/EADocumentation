# EastAnt-Atlantis documentation
Welcome to the EastAnt-Atlantis model documentation. Here you can find references and points of contact for the research and resources behind the development of the model.

## EastAnt structure
The EastAnt model is the result of a large collaborative effort of data collation, analysis, and interpretation. The model draws from various sources:
- physical domain: ACCESS-OM2-CICE and the COSIMA community (see (Kiss et al. 2020)[https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/13/401/2020/gmd-13-401-2020.html] for model description)
- biological information: SOKI (Southern Ocean Wiki, [https://sokiaq.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ABOUT/overview?mode=global]) and the community behind it, as well as models and literature published after SOKI's inception
- other inputs: iron forcing from ACCESS-AM2 (dust deposition), with data used in J. Weis et al. 2024 ([https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07366-4])
