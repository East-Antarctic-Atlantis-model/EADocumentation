# EastAnt Atlantis documentation
Welcome to the EastAnt Atlantis documentation.

## EastAnt structure
The EastAnt model is the result of a large collaborative effort of data collation, analysis, and interpretation. The model draws from various sources:
- physical domain: ACCESS-OM2-CICE and the COSIMA community (see Kiss et al. 2020 for model description: [https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/13/401/2020/gmd-13-401-2020.html])
- biological information: SOKI (Southern Ocean Wiki, [https://sokiaq.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ABOUT/overview?mode=global]) and the community behind it, as well as models and literature published after SOKI's inception
